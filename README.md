h1. External Import Test Data

This TYPO3 CMS extension provides test data for extension "external_import".
These import scenarios are not documented, but can also be used as examples
for those wanting to take a look at more complex configurations.

Currently these tests are just run manually. In the future this extension
should provide the basis for running unit tests of "external_import".

If this does not make any sense, start by looking at
http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/external_import.
